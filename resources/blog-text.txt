Pizzeria Otto Goes to Italy

The Pizzeria Otto team is all about delivering authentic Neapolitan pizza to Portland's Roseway neighborhood, and to make the magic happen, it recently completed a research trip to Naples, Italy. Aside from the ingredients, Neapolitan pizza bares little resemblance to the sliced pizzas most of us are most familiar with, and Pizzeria Otto cooks its pizzas inside of a 900-degree oven in about 90 seconds for a soft center and charred outer crust. As owner Clark Hale shows below, that's just how it's done in Naples.

Wherever the Pizzeria Otto team went, they asked locals for their favorite pizzeria recommendations. "Our first pizza of the trip was actually in a coffee shop. After a heated discussion involving employees, customers, and passersby from the street, the shopkeeper told us to wait for him as he ran a few doors down and brought us his favorite pie: Gino Sorbillo pizzeria's Margherita di Bufala."

"You'll never find sliced pizzas in Naples. The soft crusts and the generous toppings and sauce would never survive the journey from plate to mouth intact. Neapolitan pizza is truly a different animal— Mostly, Neapolitans use a knife and fork. This softness is a signature, and something that Neapolitans strive for in their pies."

What to Expect at a Neapolitan Pizzeria

Things I've overheard in a Neapolitan pizzeria lately:

"Oh, wow, there's not that much cheese on this."
"They're pretty small. You could probably eat one yourself." (Waitress to customer.)
"You can't really pick it up."
I guess that even after the great American pizza renaissance of the 2000s, Neapolitan pizza is still new to some folks. And that's OK. I just figured I'd try to demystify it a bit if you've never had it.

First thing you're going to want to know is how much to order. This is probably the No. 1 issue I've see other customers struggle with. A typical Neapolitan pizza is about 12 inches in diameter—slightly larger than a frisbee. A person of average appetites will be able to eat an entire Neapolitan pizza by him- or herself.

That is to say: Always order 1 pizza per person. Don't try to split it. You'll leave hungry. Besides, more than any American-style pizza, I always see a Neapolitan pizza night as a true variety show. Round up three of your friends, each order a different pizza, and then share them all. It's the best way to get a feel for a pizzeria's range and abilities.
